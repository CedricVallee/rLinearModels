# rLinearModels
This repository contains code to implement basic R linear models: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge Regression (RR) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. Code is included to compare the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the three methods and the norms of the estimators (L1 and L2).
